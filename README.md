# WebGL Experiments

This is just a space for me to put stuff I test WebGL code with. I'm learning WebGL basics for a possible project and mostly for kicks.

This repository is unlikely to ever contain code that's worthy of using or sharing for any purpose whatsoever. It's probably gonna contain code of such quality that I wouldn't really want people sharing it. In fact, I don't even know why you're here reading this. Why *are* you here reading this? Don't you have something better to do?

Okay Siddarth stop rambling now.
